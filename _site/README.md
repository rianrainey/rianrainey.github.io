Jekyll blog for Rian Rainey

## Get Started

```
jekyll serve
```

## Deploy

Just push to Github. `github-pages` gem takes care of the rest.

## Theme

The theme I chose for simplistic design was
[pixyll.com](http://www.pixyll.com). It's not the cleanist codebase, but
it will work to start.

Pixyll is a simple, beautiful theme for Jekyll that emphasizes content rather than aesthetic fluff. It's mobile _first_, fluidly responsive, and delightfully lightweight.
