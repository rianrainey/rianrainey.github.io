summary: Early bird gets the worm. A productive day begins with waking up early and here is my first attempt at that in a long time.

Today, I'm giving "Becoming A Morning Person" another chance to be a
habit in my life. I recently read an article on
[99U](http://99u.com/workbook/19887/labrat-become-a-morning-person) that
encourgaged readers to wake up early in an effort to be more productive
and happy. I decided to join this movement. I spoke so much about this
that my wife decided to do day 1 with me too. You can follow more of the
movement with the hastag,

Here was my schedule for night/day 1:

- **9:30pm** - Start getting ready for bed
- **9:45pm** - Roughly list items to do at 6am
- **10:00pm** - Go to sleep
- **6:00am** - Attempt to wake up. Reset alarm to 6:30am.
- **6:30am** - Convince my wife to get up with me since she requested that
encouragement.
- **6:45am** - With coffee in hand, I read my text messages and found my brother
wanted me to listen to his recent podcast episode. So, I derailed once again from my to
do list and listened to the podcast.
- **7:00am** - Convince my wife to let me go upstairs where I could be alone
to journal for 1/2 hour.
- **7:15am** - Journaling results in getting motivated to do work. So I stop
journaling early to start coding. My email is open so I'm getting
inundated with auto-generated subscription emails. Responded to a few
emails and then promptly closed it.
- **7:30am** - Coding results in me debugging my Octopress blog install for
the next 1.5 hours before I really need to start doing some real,
"pay-the-bills", work.
 
## Takeaways

I set out to do tons of work in the morning but didn't get nearly as
much done as I wanted. It was a good start to the "morning person"
routine, I believe. 

Things I want to do better tomorrow:

- Wake up at 6am. No snoozing.
- Don't read email, text messages, Twitter, or Instagram before 9am.
- Set out to accomplish only 1 thing in the morning instead of
attempting to do many things.
- Keep journaling in my morning routine.
- Make sure my wife has tasks to accomplish so I'm free to work :)
