Jekyll blog for Rian Rainey

## Get Started

```
jekyll serve
```

## Deploy

Just push to Github. `github-pages` gem takes care of the rest.

## Theme

The theme I chose was [pixyll.com](http://www.pixyll.com).

Pixyll is a simple, beautiful theme for Jekyll that emphasizes content rather than aesthetic fluff. It's mobile _first_, fluidly responsive, and delightfully lightweight.
